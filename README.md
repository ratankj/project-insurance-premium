# Problem Statement
Insurance are beneficial to anyone looking to protect their family, assets/property and themselves from financial risk/losses. Insurance plans will help you pay for medical emergencies, hospitalisation, contraction of any illnesses and treatment, and medical care required in the future. The financial loss to the family due to the unfortunate death of the sole earner can be covered by insurance plans. This is a regression problem, in which persons information and health details are taken to predict how much espense is required for their insurance premium.
